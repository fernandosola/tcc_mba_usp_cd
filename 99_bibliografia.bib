  abstract  = {Participation of citizens in the process of city development is very important. To achieve good governance and democratic, the citizen can participate by providing complaints, information, or advices. In the current system, complaints are handled manually by 1-2 operators, whereas speed and accuracy are needed. The problem is this manual handling causes errors in the determination of appropriate government departments that handle the complaint. This research will propose a system that aims to determine the appropriate government department with complaints given by the citizen with the implementation of K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) algorithm, to reduce human errors. This algorithm is one of text classification algorithms, which in this research, is used to classify complaints which the texts in Indonesian language. The input of the system is complaint given by the citizen and the output is the name of the appropriate government department, which is in accordance with the contents of the complaint.},

  abstract  = {Today metropolitan citizens need a common platform to register their complaints. In the traditional telephonic system task of complaint registration is very time-consuming process so, citizen have to wait until call is received by the service executive. The proposed framework is developed for Pune Municipal corporation (PMC) will be very helpful for registering queries in natural language and get immediate response. Understanding the short text is the main challenge of the system as short text do not follow syntax of the written language, short text does not have sufficient statistics to support approach of text mining, short text is noisy and ambiguous. So, traditional Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging tools cannot be easily applied. In proposed framework for understanding natural language semantic knowledge provided by well-known knowledgebase WordNet is used. In prequery citizens inserts complaint to system and get immediate response to query with the help of knowledgebase and machine learning algorithm. In postquery system analyses the citizen sentiment to handle grievance level and accordingly prioritize the citizens by sentiment analysis. The proposed framework will help many organizations to ensure quality service provision and customer satisfaction with less human efforts.},

There are several applications that can be built by applying OSSMInt techniques on this human-sensor data. In this paper, we present some of the use-cases of OSSMInt that are useful for the public sector agencies for e-governance. E-governance on social media include the identification of complaints and grievances reported online by the public citizens for the government authorities and facilitate public agencies to response those complaints, provide better services and improve their connections with public citizens. We present the basic Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning based framework, tools and techniques within the context of OSSMInt and E-governance. The focus of this paper is on mining user-generated content on Twitter (the most popular social media and microblogging website) to identify public citizens complaints and grievances. In particular, we focus on two important applications: (1) complaints which are reported to spread awareness among other citizens and to bring government's attention to the issues reported in the complaint, and (2) complaints which seek for immediate action and response from the concerned authorities. In addition to the basic introduction and motivation, we will discuss the unique challenges to these applications, open research problems, important literature, proposed approach, experimental results, and future directions.},
